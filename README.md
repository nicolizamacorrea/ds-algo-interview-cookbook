## Data Structures and Algorithms Interview Cookbook

This repository holds implementation of widely used data structures and algorithms, and solutions to questions asked during tech interviews around these two core CS subjects.

The questions are picked up from various coding platforms, books, actual interviews etc.

- Implementation, solutions have been coded in C++ 17 or Python 3.
- Basic algorithms can be found inside [algorithms-and-ds](./algorithms-and-ds) folder.
- Interview questions from coding platforms, books, actual interviews can be found inside [platform-problems](./platform-problems) folder.

#### Problems solved for challenges:

- **LeetCode**: `May 2020 LeetCoding challenge`: 30 questions, 30 days
  - Solutions available in [may-2020-leetcoding-challenge](./platform-problems/leetcode/may-2020-leetcoding-challenge) folder.
