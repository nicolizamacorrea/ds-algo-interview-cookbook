The questions are picked up from various coding platforms, books, actual interviews etc.

- Implementation, solutions have been coded in C++ 17 or Python 3.
- Basic algorithms can be found inside [basic-algorithms](./basic-algorithms) folder.
- Interview questions from coding platforms, books, actual interviews can be found inside [platform-problems](./platform-problems) folder.
